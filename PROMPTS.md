- The validation didn't do anything, answer: it wasn't implemented anywhere

```
#file:/home/seya/code/01/skill-test/apps/zog-news/domain/article.go
#file:/home/seya/code/01/skill-test/apps/zog-news/service/article.go

How and where does the validator work? I sent a post request without Author and Content key but it still gets created even though the validator is required?
```

```
#files:**/*.go

Can you find where the validation happens?
```

```
based on my codebase, where should i implement the validator?
```
